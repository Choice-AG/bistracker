**WARNING:** This project is **not** for you, it's for **me** and my small group of nerds. You won’t like it, and I don’t care. You can thank Twitter for making me create this repo because y’all don’t know how to chill.

## What is this?

This is a **Best In Slot (BIS) tracker** for World of Warcraft players in my group. Yes, it’s hardcoded. No, I’m not planning on changing that, because this isn’t designed for the public. It tracks dungeons, items, and which player needs what. If you’re not **[Reizan](https://x.com/ReizanMir)**, **[Mizu](https://x.com/mizuedg)**, **[Sheciro](https://x.com/Sheciro)**, or **[Parteyunques](https://x.com/parteyunques)**, this project isn’t for you.

If you want to know how it works, it’s simple:

-   **HTML/CSS** for structure. It's dark mode because, let’s face it, light mode sucks.
- **JavaScript** for loading data (yes, hardcoded data, because why would I bother with a database when this is for four people? Yep, I said it again, **hardcoded**. No databases, no dynamic backend, no nonsense.).
-   Tooltips from Wowhead because we're not savages.

## What’s Inside?

-   `index.html`: The "beautiful" HTML file. It's dark. It uses Bootstrap. It tells you if you owe me a coffee. It’s as basic as it gets.
    
-   `styles.css`: Makes it look slightly less like a dumpster fire. You’ll find all the pretty class colors for WoW because we like things to match, and it’s dark mode because my eyes don’t deserve to suffer.
    
-   `scripts.js`: The magic. This is where the data is loaded (from a JS object, because again, **hardcoded**). It splits the items by player and dungeon and lets you know what you’ve still gotta loot. If you want to deal with changing Wowhead IDs, knock yourself out. But honestly, **I’d rather slam my dick in a piano lid than waste my time doing it​**.

## Installation?

No, there’s no fancy installation process. You download the files, throw them on a web server, and boom, it’s live.

## Can I use this?

Technically, yes. But unless you're in my Mythic+ group, you probably don’t want to. And if you’re here hoping for some nice open-source tool, lol nope.

## Can I fork it?

Sure, but if you wanna fork this and spend your time swapping Wowhead IDs and items, that’s your problem, not mine. I’ve got better things to do, like make myself a coffee. No support, no complaints. If it breaks, that’s on you.

## License

None. Zero. Nada. This is personal use only, and I’m not interested in feature requests or bug reports. This is the end of the line. If you want to take this and change it, feel free, but don't expect me to care.
